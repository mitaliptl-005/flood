## Flood Analysis using CNN + LSTM

A deep learning-based approach to analyze and predict flood patterns using a hybrid **CNN+LSTM** model. This project combines spatial feature extraction with temporal sequence modeling to provide accurate flood prediction and analysis from time-series or image-based data.

# Objective

To develop a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) + Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model for efficient flood detection, classification, and prediction based on historical data, satellite imagery, or sensor time series.

# Model Architecture

- **CNN Layers**: Extract spatial or local features from input data (e.g., image patches or sensor frames).
- **LSTM Layers**: Model the temporal dependencies or sequential patterns in flood-related data.
- **Dense Layers**: Final classification or regression layers for output prediction.

# Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and evaluation)
